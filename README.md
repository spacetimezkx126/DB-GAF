# DB-GAF: A Novel Graph-Based Dual-Branch Framework for Legal Case Retrieval with Attribute Filtering

This repository provides the implementation of **DB-GAF**, a novel graph-based dual-branch framework for legal case retrieval with attribute filtering. The model leverages a graph-based approach to retrieve legal cases by considering both the graph structure of the data and the attribute filtering to improve retrieval accuracy.
